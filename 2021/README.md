## [Moving from Dockerfiles to Buildpacks](/2021/Paketo)

Are you tired of updating your application dependencies in your Dockerfiles?
Would you like to try buildpacks, but you don’t know where to start? In this
session, we will demonstrate how you can move your application from a
Dockerfile to buildpacks. Once we move our application onto buildpacks, we’ll
show how you can keep your application dependencies up-to-date. We’ll cover the
details of what the buildpacks are doing, and what that means you can stop
doing.
