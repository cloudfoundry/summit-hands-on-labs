## Introduction

In this hands-on lab attendees will learn how to install Stratos to Kubernetes using Helm. They will then learn how to register and connect different types of Stratos endpoints and use them to explore the new Kubernetes and Helm functionality in Stratos. 

### Steps

The presenters will demonstrate each step. Time and assistance will then be provided for attendees to complete each step before the presenters continue onto the next.

Steps include

1. Access your personal Google Cloud Shell environment
1. Set up your environment
1. Install Stratos using Helm
1. Register and Connect a Kubernetes Endpoint
1. Register Helm Endpoints and Install a Helm Chart
1. Explore Kubernetes Features
1. Explore Kubernetes Tech Preview Features
1. Explore some existing Cloud Foundry Features

### What you will need
1. Browser

### What we will provide
1. Google credentials used to access Google Cloud Shell
1. Personal Kubernetes Cluster associated with your Google credentials

## Access your personal environment

In this step we will gather your lab credentials and bring up your Google Cloud Shell environment.

### Receive your Google Credentials
1. The instructors will provide you with Google credentials to use during the session. These will be used to access Google Cloud Shell and it's resources.

### Start Google Cloud Shell 
1. Open the link below in incognito/private mode and log in using the credentials provided above.
   > Note The incognito mode ensures you can log in using the credentials provided. This is important and should not be skipped

   > Note You may be prompted to 'Trust' the session's repository with your temporary google credentials. You should allow this by clicking `Confirm`

   > Note - It may take a minute or two for the Google Shell environment to start up
