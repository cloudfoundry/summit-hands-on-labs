## Introduction

In this hands on lab you will perform several tasks, some for those wearing a developer hat and some for those wearing an operator hat, on `KubeCF`, which is a containerized Cloud Foundry deployment on Kubernetes. `KubeCF` brings the developer experience of Cloud Foundry to Kubernetes in a production-ready environment.

### Target Audience

This lab is targeted towards an audience who would like to use Cloud Foundry for packaging and deploying applications with Kubernetes as the underlying infrastructure for container orchestration.

### Learning Objectives

You will be performing the following tasks in this lab :-

#### Developer Tasks

* Installation of `KubeCF` platform in Kubernetes.
* Push an application using `cf push`.
* Installation of Minibroker in Kubernetes.
* Create a Redis database instance and connect it to your application.

#### Operator Tasks

* Scale up Diego cells in the `KubeCF` platform.
* Rotate the encryption key of the cloud controller database.

### Prerequisites

Audience must have basic knowledge of Cloud Foundry and Kubernetes.

## Lab

### Google Cloud Shell

We recommend you increase the size of the cloudshell terminal to the largest size available.

### Using the CLI

You will have access to `kubectl`, `helm`, `cf`, `cf7` in the terminal.

* `kubectl` is a command line interface for running commands against Kubernetes clusters.
* `helm` is a command line tool for managing Kubernetes applications, used for installing and upgrading KubeCF on Kubernetes cluster.
* `CF CLI` is a command line tool for managing Cloud Foundry applications. cf7 version is required for a new rolling updates feature.

#### Authenticate

To work with Kubernetes you need a valid `KUBECONFIG`. The following commands will acquire a config from Google Cloud.

You should replace the variable *[seat]* with the number in your email address. Ex:- In the email address 1-summitlabs@cloudfoundry.org, 1 is your *[seat]*. For seat numbers 1 to 30, zone=a, 31 to 60, zone=b & 61 to 100, zone=c.


    seat=[seat]
    zone=[zone]

Get the clustername.

    clustername=na-cluster-"$seat"

Get the kubeconfig.

    gcloud container clusters get-credentials \
    "$clustername" --zone europe-west2-$zone \
    --project summit-labs


To check if the connection was successful run


    kubectl version
    helm version
    cf version
    cf7 version


If you can see the versions for all the commands, then you are good to go ahead.

## Developer Hat

### Installing KubeCF

`KubeCF` is already installed for you in the GKE cluster as it takes approximately 15 minutes for the installation. It only takes 2 helm commands to install, one for `Quarks` and other for `KubeCF`. `Quarks` is a kubernetes operator.

* Do not run these helm commands. They are already executed for you.
```
helm repo add quarks https://cloudfoundry-incubator.github.io/quarks-helm/
helm install cf-operator quarks/cf-operator --set global.operator.watchNamespace=kubecf --version 4.5.6
```
```
helm install kubecf --namespace kubecf \
--set "system_domain= na$seat.kubecf.net" \
--set "features.ingress.enabled=true" \
https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/kubecf/releases/download/v2.2.2/kubecf-v2.2.2.tgz
```


Now, check if all the Cloud Foundry components (pods) are in running status. The database-seeder pod should be in complated status.


    watch kubectl get pods -n kubecf

Press `Ctrl+C` to exit the watch.



### Pushing an App

Pushing an app into `KubeCF`, requires a configured `Cloud Foundry CLI`. You shall now configure the CLI with the domain name `"na$seat.kubecf.net"` which points to the installed KubeCF platform.

* Set the KubeCF API url.

        cf api --skip-ssl-validation \
        http://api.na"$seat".kubecf.net

* Login using the user admin, so that you have full access to the `KubeCF` platform.

        admin_password=$(kubectl get secret \
        -n kubecf var-cf-admin-password \
        -o jsonpath="{.data.password}" | base64 --decode)
        cf login -u admin -p "${admin_password}"

* Create an organisation and space where you can push applications.

        cf create-org demo
        cf target -o demo
        cf create-space demo
        cf target -s demo

* Push an application into `KubeCF` platform using the `cf push` command.

        git clone https://github.com/rohitsakala/cf-redis-example-app
        cd cf-redis-example-app
        cf push
 

In a PaaS platform like `KubeCF`, only the application is managed by the developer, everything else is managed by `KubeCF`.

Check if the app has been successfully deployed.

* Go to url in the browser. Make sure to replace the `$seat` variable.
```
http://redis-example-app.na$seat.kubecf.net
```

OR

* Curl the url.

        curl http://redis-example-app.na$seat.kubecf.net


So, you have successfully deployed an application into KubeCF platform. Let's now connect to a database.

#### Troubleshooting

If you want to re-install, delete the app and retry the section.

    cf delete redis-example-app


## Developer Hat

### Install Minibroker

Minibroker is an open source service broker based on [Open Service Broker API](https://www.openservicebrokerapi.org/). Using service brokers, Cloud Foundry apps can connect to external services such as databases, SaaS applications etc. Services deployed in Kubernetes can also be connected using service brokers.

* Install Minibroker using helm.

* Create minibroker namespace.
  
        cd ..
        kubectl create ns minibroker

* Add minibroker helm rpo

        helm repo add suse https://kubernetes-charts.suse.com
        helm install minibroker --namespace minibroker suse/minibroker \
        --set "defaultNamespace=minibroker"
        cat minibroker-ingress.yaml | sed "s/replace/'minibroker.na$seat.kubecf.net'/g" \
        | kubectl apply -f -


* Check if the minibroker pod is running.

        watch kubectl get pods -n minibroker
        
Press `Ctrl+C` to exit.

* Connect minibroker to `KubeCF` platform.


        cf create-service-broker minibroker \
        user123 password http://minibroker.na$seat.kubecf.net

* List the redis database services and their associated plans the minibroker has access to :- 


        cf service-access -b minibroker | grep redis

* Lets choose a plan and create one in the next steps.

#### Troubleshooting

If you want to re-install, uninstall the helm release and re-install.


        echo y | cf delete-service-broker minibroker 
        helm uninstall minibroker -n minibroker


### Create a Redis Database Instance

Lets now enable a redis database service in the minibroker, create a security group, and create an instance of redis database.

* Enable redis service.

        cf enable-service-access redis -b minibroker -p 4-0-10

* Create & bind security group

        echo > redis.json '[{ "protocol": "tcp", "destination": "10.0.0.0/8", "ports": "6379", "description": "Allow Redis traffic" }]'
        cf create-security-group redis_networking redis.json        
        cf bind-security-group redis_networking demo demo

* Create a redis plan service.

        cf create-service redis 4-0-10 redis-example-service


Check if the redis master and slave pods are running.


        watch kubectl get pods --namespace minibroker

Press `Ctrl+C` to exit.

Check the status of the service creation. Wait until the creation is competed.


        watch cf service redis-example-service

Press `Ctrl+C` to exit.

#### Troubleshooting

If you want to re-create, delete the service and retry.


        cf delete-service redis-example-service


## Developer Hat

### Connect Redis to App

Bind the redis database instace to your pushed application.

    cf bind-service redis-example-app redis-example-service

You need to restage/restart your application for the redis configuration to be pushed into your app environment. Lets do rolling update with zero downtime.

    cd cf-redis-example-app
    cf7 push redis-example-app --strategy rolling


When the application is ready, it can be tested by storing a value into the Redis database.

* The first curl `GET` will return `key not present`, since we did not store any value for the key `foo`.

        curl --request GET http://redis-example-app.na$seat.kubecf.net/foo

* The second curl `PUT` will return `success`, since we stored the value `bar` for the key `foo`.

        curl --request PUT http://redis-example-app.na$seat.kubecf.net/foo --data 'data=bar'

* The third curl `GET` will return `bar`, since we stored the value of the key `foo` as `bar` in the previous curl.

        curl --request GET http://redis-example-app.na$seat.kubecf.net/foo


To summarize, you have deployed KubeCF, pushed an application, created a redis database instance using minibroker and connected it to your application.

#### Troubleshooting

If you want to re-bind, unbind the service and retry the above commands.


    cf unbind-service redis-example-app redis-example-service


## Operations Hat

### Scale your Diego Cells

There will come a situation in your company in which you need to push more apps. Easy !!!! Scale up the diego cells.

* Upgrade kubecf platform by setting the instances for diego-cell pod to 2. The value can be changed using `--set` argument of helm. We need to set `sizing.diego_cell.instances` to 2.

        helm upgrade kubecf --namespace kubecf \
        --set "sizing.diego_cell.instances=2" \
        --set "system_domain=na$seat.kubecf.net" \
        --set "features.ingress.enabled=true" \
        https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/kubecf/releases/download/v2.2.2/kubecf-v2.2.2.tgz 


Note: A list of configurable values can be found at [values](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/kubecf/blob/master/deploy/helm/kubecf/values.yaml
).

A new pod `diego-cell-1` should be running :-

    watch kubectl get pods -n kubecf

Note: This will take 7 minutes. So, you can take a break.

Press `Ctrl+C` to exit.

Now, check if your app still exists.
* Go to url in the browser. Make sure to replace the `$seat` variable.
```console
http://redis-example-app.na$seat.kubecf.net/foo
```

OR

* Curl the url.

        curl http://redis-example-app.na$seat.kubecf.net/foo


## Operations Hat

### Rotate Cloud Controller encryption key

Lets perform another operator task. Suppose you need to rotate your cloud controller database encryption key. CAPI release has an errand job which rotates your database encryption key. QuarksJob is used to run BOSH errand jobs in KubeCF world.

* Check if there is a QuarksJob for rotation

        kubectl -n kubecf get quarksjobs rotate-cc-database-key

* Trigger it now

        kubectl patch qjob rotate-cc-database-key \
        --namespace kubecf \
        --type merge \
        --patch '{"spec":{"trigger":{"strategy":"now"}}}'

* Wait for few seconds and check if the rotation was succesful by checking the logs

```
podName=`kubectl -n kubecf get pod -l quarks.cloudfoundry.org/qjob-name=rotate-cc-database-key -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}'`
kubectl -n kubecf logs $podName rotate-cc-database-key-rotate | grep "Done rotating encryption key for class"
```
