Thought: would be cool to have slides and terminal side-by-side
1. Pass out a basket with usernames/passwords (as they get seated)
1. Sign in to a cloud shell ourselves with one of the usernames
1. Present opening slides
1. Is everyone at a machine with the cloud shell open? If not, please raise your hand.
1. Go to the next slide and tell everyone to ssh in. Is everyone in? Let us know if not.
1. HTTP endpoints slides and very briefly give an overview of what we've implemented.
1. Go to the next slide and CF Push.
1. During Cf push, explain service broker creation process.
1. Can everyone run cf apps and see their app runnning?
1. Register the broker with some random name (anything you want, but different from your neighbors)
1. Create a serivce instance in cloud foundry. 
1. Create a simple application in Cloud Foundry
1. Create a binding between the service instance and application
1. See that the binding has caused Cloud Foundry to inject credentials into our app. \
